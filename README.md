### Disclaimer

This application was written for a challenge so it had strict requirements and limited time, what explains most of the non-ideal decisions like:

 * less functionalities than I'd have created otherwise
 * no php pre-made components (or I'd have used composer)
 * some functional errors might not have been handled
 * ENUM was used in the database =/
 * no error reporting by email
 * no Dependency Injection Container was built
 * the main classes are to be reordered within their proper directories

### Languages, tools and standards

 * PHPOO
 * Javascript
 * MySQL
 * MVC
 * API*
 * ORM*
 * Templating Engine*
 * AJAX
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * jQuery
 * Font Awesome
 * Error Handling*

\*built from scratch

## Components

In order to elaborate a more complete and finished solution, I opted for a few ready to use open source components in the Front End:

**Front-end:**

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Javascript micro framework
* [notify.js](https://notifyjs.com) - Message display
* [jquery-modal](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal) - Modal display

The Back End was entirely built from scratch.
